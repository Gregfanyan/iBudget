## Income

The income page displays all income data. Users have a year calendar where they can add all monthly incomes divided by categories for each month. Users have 5 different types of income categories and can add, edit or delete income categories per month, displayed in a income table. The calendar switches between years and updates in real time with an overview of monthly income displayed in a highlighted tile content. Users have also access to a category chart that updates in real time when adding, editing or deleting income data. Monthly budget and income is updated on real time.

## Expenses

Users can track all monthly expenses on the expenses page. The calendar shown in the expenses pages is a monthly calendar, which displays all daily data regarding expenses, including total expenses for the month and monthly budget. Users can select between 12 type of expenses categories and add, edit and delete expenses which are displayed on the expenses table. Just like the income page, tile contents can highlight daily expenses on the calendar which can be viewed by hovering on the calendar days. An expenses chart by categories updates on real time when data is added, edit or deleted.

## Analytics

The analytics page gives an overview of all year and monthly expenses and income, with year and monthly budget. User can switch between year and monthly view. While on year view, the user can see the total amount of expenses, income and total budget, together with a decade calendar and a chart displaying all expenses and income for the selected year. By switching to month view and clicking to different months, the user can view an aggregate of all expenses and income per month in a year calendar, and a monthly chart displaying total expenses and income.
